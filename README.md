# Rainremindbot
This project is a Python-based weather monitoring service that checks for rain in multiple global cities every 30 minutes. If rain is detected, a notification is sent to a LINE Notify account. The project uses OpenWeatherMap for weather data and Ngrok to expose the local Flask server to the public for testing purposes.
